Chessboard Computer Vision Project

## Project Overview
I would like to create a dataset of annotated chess board images with the board setup. Then I would like to train a deep learning model to classify chess board positions using nothing but images. This may be a good dataset for a community kaggle competition (pogchamps?)

Eventually the project would produce an app that could be used in real time to track a game's progress using video.

## Workflow

0. Read existing papers on the topic.
- https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/prev_projects_2016/CS_231A_Final_Report.pdf
- http://vision.fe.uni-lj.si/cvww2016/proceedings/papers/21.pdf

1. Gather the data
- Youtube scraping
    - Need to hand label or extract from game labels.
- My own images- setup the board and label.

## Things to figure out

1. How the labels will look?
    - FEN
2. Test out object detection
